# TripNest Frontend

This directory hosts the React + Vite application that powers the TripNest user experience. It consumes the REST API exposed by the Express backend to deliver destination discovery, travel bookings, and admin workflows.

## Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Configure the API base URL through `VITE_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:5000/api`). For full project documentation refer to the root `README.md`.
